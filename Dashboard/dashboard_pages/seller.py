Categories like computers, toys, and baby products follow closely, maintaining a competitive seller count between 100 and 200. As the chart progresses to the right, the number of sellers gradually decreases, showing less competition in specialized categories like security products, CNG stations, and cars & models. This suggests that while some product areas have a robust seller presence, niche categories offer opportunities for new sellers due to limited competition."

    insight_revenue_3 = "In general, there is a positive correlation between seller rating and the number of orders, where higher-rated sellers (4.0 to 5.0) tend to receive more orders, while lower-rated sellers (below 2.0) receive fewer orders, typically less than 1000. However, there are exceptions where some low-rated sellers still manage to obtain a relatively high number of orders, although this is rare. For ratings above 4.0, the frequency of orders increases significantly, with many sellers receiving between 1000 to 5000 orders, and some even exceeding 6000, especially around ratings of 4.8 to 5.0, indicating a very high order volume. Although many high-rated sellers receive large orders, there are also those who receive only a small number, suggesting that factors other than rating also influence the number of orders."
