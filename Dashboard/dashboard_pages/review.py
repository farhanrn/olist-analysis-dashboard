    insight_review = "The Review Analysis chart provides insights into customer review scores and their relationship with average delivery times. On the left, the Total Review Score Calculation from All Customers bar chart shows that the highest number of reviews (64,859) are rated 5, indicating a strong customer preference for high ratings. Lower scores have fewer reviews, with ratings of 1 and 2 having significantly fewer customers, suggesting dissatisfaction may lead to lower engagement. On the right, the Average Delivery Time vs Average Review Score chart reveals that delivery time slightly decreases as the review score increases, with an average delivery time of about 24.5 days for scores 1 and 2, gradually reducing to approximately 23 days for scores 4 and 5. This suggests a potential link between faster delivery times and higher customer satisfaction."
